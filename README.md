# Bio-Pedigrees
A terminal-based inheritance tree navigator, useful for mapping out complex family structures where visual UI display is non-essential. Fully text-interactive.
## A Bit about Implementation
The whole idea of an inheritance tree is based upon tree nodes. In this program, a modified n-ary tree data structure is used for easy linking. Maybe I will add more features later (eg maximum depth, level order traversal with BFS, and some other things). If you would like to learn more about trees, then go to LeetCode for some practice problems.
